## üìã MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Create Private Repository
1. Create `frame-economics-private` repository
2. Copy complete codebase to private repo
3. Set up proper access controls
4. Add business documentation and roadmap

### Phase 2: Sanitize Public Repository  
1. Remove advanced content and full rule implementations
2. Replace with educational samples and placeholders
3. Add clear documentation about educational purpose
4. Update licensing for educational/academic use

### Phase 3: Create Connection Strategy
1. Public repo becomes "Frame Economics Educational Demo"
2. Add links to private/commercial version
3. Create clear upgrade path for users
4. Maintain brand consistency across both repos
