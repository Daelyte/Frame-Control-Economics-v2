ANIMATED OG BANNER VIDEOS NEEDED:

Please save the generated animated videos from the Python script:

1. og_animated_seamless.mp4 
   - The MP4 version for broad compatibility
   - Should be ~6 seconds, looping seamlessly
   - Optimized at 4000k bitrate

2. og_animated_seamless.webm
   - The WebM version for better compression
   - Should be ~6 seconds, looping seamlessly  
   - Optimized at 2500k bitrate

FEATURES OF THE ANIMATED BANNER:
- Gentle parallax zoom/pan effect
- Teal glow pulse on the knight chess piece area
- Animated tech-grid overlay
- Soft vignette and subtle grain
- Moving light sweep across the design
- Seamless 6-second loop

The AnimatedOGBanner component will automatically:
- Load the WebM version first (better compression)
- Fallback to MP4 for compatibility
- Use the static OG image as poster/fallback
- Handle loading states and errors gracefully

Place both video files in the /public directory of the project.
