## 🎪 **Background Mix**

I've worked across **advertising**, **e-commerce**, **tech sales**, and **nightlife production**—giving me a unique perspective on connecting with people and creating value in any environment. 

From analyzing market trends for Fortune 500 campaigns to reading crowd energy at 2AM warehouse events, I've learned that success comes from understanding people, timing, and authentic connection.

*Current focus*: Translating this experience into tech sales excellence, with AI as my coding companion and the terminal as my creative playground.
