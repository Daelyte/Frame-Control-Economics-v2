# Frame Economics V2 - Development Workflow & Automation

## üöÄ Git Workflow Automation Rule

**RULE**: Every code change follows this mandatory sequence:
1. ‚úÖ Code implementation & testing
2. ‚úÖ Automatic Git commit with detailed message
3. ‚úÖ Push to main branch
4. ‚úÖ Verify Netlify deployment success
5. ‚úÖ Create detailed chronological notes
6. ‚úÖ Wait for deployment confirmation before proceeding

### Automation Commands

```bash
# Standard workflow command
npm run deploy-workflow

# Emergency deployment (bypasses some checks)
npm run emergency-deploy

# Verify deployment status
npm run verify-deployment
```

## üìù Chronological Development Log

### Session Started: 2025-09-27T03:57:07Z

#### Pre-Analysis: Current State
- **Project**: Vite-based React app with TypeScript
- **Current Stack**: React 19.1.1, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion 12.23.22
- **Deployment**: frame-control.netlify.app
- **Goal**: Transform to unforgettable Next.js + Tailwind + Motion experience

#### Todo List Created
1. üîÑ Create Git workflow automation rule and analyze current project state
2. ‚è≥ Initialize Next.js 15 + TypeScript foundation with modern tooling
3. ‚è≥ Implement design system and Tailwind configuration
4. ‚è≥ Build core layout and hero section with motion system
5. ‚è≥ Add performance optimization and SEO foundation
6. ‚è≥ Set up 3D dragon hero (R3F) with mobile fallbacks
7. ‚è≥ Integrate CMS and content management system
8. ‚è≥ Implement security, analytics, and deployment optimization

#### Decision Points & Architecture Choices
- **Migration Strategy**: Transform existing Vite ‚Üí Next.js App Router
- **Preserve**: Current R3F setup, Framer Motion, existing components
- **Enhance**: Add Next.js ISR, improved SEO, performance optimization
- **Design**: Implement "tactile neo-luxury" theme with deep jade/teal palette
