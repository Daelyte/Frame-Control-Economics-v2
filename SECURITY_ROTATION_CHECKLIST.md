# 🔐 Security Checklist - API Key Rotation

## ✅ **Immediate Actions Required**

### **1. Rotate Supabase Keys (URGENT)**
- [ ] **Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API**
- [ ] **Rotate the `service_role` key** (the one that was exposed)
- [ ] **Rotate the `anon/public` key** (for good measure)
- [ ] **Copy the new keys**

### **2. Update Environment Variables**
- [ ] **Replace `YOUR_NEW_PROJECT_ID`** in `.env.local` with your actual project ID
- [ ] **Replace `YOUR_NEW_ANON_KEY_HERE`** with your new anon key
- [ ] **Replace `YOUR_NEW_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_HERE`** with your new service role key

### **3. Test the New Configuration**
- [ ] **Run `npm run dev`**
- [ ] **Navigate to the 🧪 Test tab**
- [ ] **Verify all tests pass:**
  - ✅ Supabase Connection
  - ✅ Database Tables  
  - ✅ Authentication (when you log in)
  - ✅ Permissions

### **4. Additional Security Measures**
- [ ] **Check Supabase logs** for any unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] **Review your authentication providers** (GitHub/Google OAuth settings)
- [ ] **Enable email notifications** for API key changes in Supabase
- [ ] **Set up monitoring** for unusual database activity

## ⚠️ **What the Exposed Key Could Access**
The `service_role` key has admin-level access to your Supabase project, including:
- Full read/write access to all tables
- User management capabilities
- Schema modifications
- Bypassing Row Level Security (RLS)

## 🔄 **After Rotation**
Once you've rotated the keys and updated `.env.local`:

1. **The old keys are immediately invalidated**
2. **Any potential unauthorized access is cut off**
3. **Your application will work with the new keys**
4. **Community features will be secure again**

## 📝 **Future Prevention**
- Never commit `.env*` files to git
- Use environment variable management tools for production
- Regularly rotate API keys (quarterly recommended)
- Monitor access logs regularly
