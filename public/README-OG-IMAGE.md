# OG Image Setup

Please save the OG image shown in the chat as `og-image.jpg` in this directory.

The image should be:
- Filename: `og-image.jpg`
- Size: 1200x630 pixels
- The Frame Economics design with the knight chess piece

This will be used by:
- The AnimatedCSSBanner component for the hero section
- Social media previews (Open Graph/Twitter Cards)
- Fallback displays when animations are disabled

The CSS animations will add:
- Ken Burns pan/zoom effect
- Moving tech grid overlay
- Pulsing teal glow on the knight
- Diagonal light sweep
- Subtle grain texture

All animations are pure CSS and will be much more performant than video.
